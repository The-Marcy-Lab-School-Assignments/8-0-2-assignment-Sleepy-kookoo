# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer

The dangers of making API requests with API keys from the frontend is security reasons. API keys could get exposed in this format; Doing API request from the server avoids this danger because the frontend would have to request the server to get the data and the server is the one in the background doing the API key request therefore not exposing our API key.
